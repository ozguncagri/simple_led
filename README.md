# simple_led

Simple [WLED](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED) manager for Windows.

## Motivation

WLED's web panel is great but it has some problems with WebSocket; so front-end loses it's connection to back-end so often and it makes device unusable sometimes. Beside this connection problems JSON interface is always usable somehow. **Simple_led** uses this JSON interface to manage device with minimal config.
